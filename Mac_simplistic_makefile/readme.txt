DO NOT USE THIS LONGTERM
See readme.txt in parent directory.
You can run this to check your installation if you wish - copy it to your src directory and hopefully it will just compile everything if you type 'make'.
It's a very simple makefile without the details that cmake will add to the makefile it creates, so I suggest to use cmake in preference to this.
